===========================================
DISCUSSION & COMMENTS
===========================================    
'''

'''
Standard LSTM: Shows a steady improvement in validation accuracy, reaching 55.55% after 10 epochs.
Multiplicative LSTM: Achieves slightly higher validation accuracy of 55.47%, suggesting that incorporating multiplicative mechanisms might help convergence but does not significantly boost accuracy in this task.
Standard GRU: Learns quickly, reaching 55.52% accuracy by the last epoch.
Multiplicative GRU: Also achieves 55.71% final validation accuracy, indicating strong performance.

GRUs converge faster than LSTMs in the early epochs.
Multiplicative LSTMs/GRUs don't show a huge advantage in accuracy but may impact training dynamics.

All models generalize well across longer sequences, with test accuracy remaining relatively stable.
Multiplicative models slightly outperform standard ones on longer sequences, but the difference is marginal.
No catastrophic forgetting or significant accuracy drop, suggesting the models are stable even when extrapolating to longer sequences.

 Impact of Multiplicative Mechanisms
Advantages:
Potential for better long-term dependency handling (though not evident in final accuracy).
 Slightly improved accuracy on longer sequences (T=500 and T=1000).
 May provide better gradient flow (avoiding vanishing gradients).

Drawbacks:
 More complex computations (requires additional parameters for multiplicative memory).
 Slightly more hyperparameter sensitivity (e.g., tuning learning rates).
